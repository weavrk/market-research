# Fix 403 Forbidden Error

## The Problem
403 Forbidden means the server is blocking access. This could be:
1. `.htaccess` file causing conflicts
2. File permissions issue
3. Python App not properly configured

## Solution 1: Delete .htaccess (Recommended)

GoDaddy's Python App uses Passenger/WSGI which handles routing automatically. The `.htaccess` file might be interfering.

**Delete the .htaccess file:**
1. Go to **cPanel → File Manager**
2. Navigate to `/public_html/hrefs/market-research/`
3. Find `.htaccess` (you might need to show hidden files)
4. **Right-click → Delete**
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Try the site again

## Solution 2: Check File Permissions

In File Manager, check these permissions:
- `index.py` should be **755** (executable)
- `app.py` should be **644**
- `templates/` directory should be **755**
- `static/` directory should be **755**
- `data/` directory should be **755** (writable)

To change permissions:
1. Right-click the file/folder
2. Select "Change Permissions"
3. Set the correct permissions
4. Click "Change Permissions"

## Solution 3: Verify Python App Configuration

In the Python App setup, verify:
- **Application root:** `/home/weavrk/public_html/hrefs/market-research`
- **Application startup file:** `index.py`
- **Application Entry point:** `application`
- **Python version:** 3.x (NOT 2.7)

## Solution 4: Check if App is Running

In the Python App setup page:
- Make sure the app shows as **"Running"** or **"Started"**
- If it says "Stopped", click **"RESTART"**

**Start with Solution 1 (delete .htaccess) - that's most likely the issue!**
